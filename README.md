# MD<sup>2</sup> Framework


## Development

### Accessibility Research
- Gitflow is used in the development of the accessibility features. 
- The branch `accessibility` will be treated as the main branch. 
- The development (integration) of each accessibility principle in the framework will be done on a separate branch that is branched off of `accessibility` and named according to the principle, e.g. `operable`.
- Once the development is complete on the respective branch, it can be merged back into `accessibility`.
